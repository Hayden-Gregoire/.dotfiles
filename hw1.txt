It was not super difficult to complete this assignment, as essentially everything that was done
had been done in previous labs so I was able to recognize all the commands that were needed.
I already had used github from CSCE 190 so creating the ssh key and a new repository
was not new or relatively difficult for me. The assignment instructions laid all the steps out
pretty clearly as well, even providing a good amount of the commands that needed to be used as well.
The only techincaal difficulty I ran into for the assignment was working too fast and copying the
commands and I forgot to change the username template to my actual username which gave me an error.
Aside from that, I was able to move through the assignment quickly and easily. 

Commands from part 4 used:
cd ~
mkdir .dotfiles
ls -a
cd .dotfiles
pwd
touch README.md
nano README.md
cat README.md
nano .nanorc
cp .nanorc ~/
git init
git add --all
git commit -m "INIT commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:hayden-gregoire/.dotfiles
git push -u origin main
